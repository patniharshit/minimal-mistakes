Hi,
This is my first blog post, many more will follow. Here I will post about
the progress of my project along with some random posts about life, politics,
some tech tutorial or book reviews. You might ask what new does this blog add
to the already existing content on the internet. Well, the honest answer is I
don't know. This is my first attempt at writing other than mandatory academic
essays. There are two reasons why I have started this blog. First I have been
selected in GSoC and the program require writing blog. Secondly, I follow
lots of blogs on various topics on Quora/Medium etc regularly so I always
thought about writing a blog but never started one. So after my selection in
GSoC first thing I did was to set up a blog.

One month back when I submitted my proposal for GSoC to Matplotlib, NumFocus I
never thought that I will be accepted. All this time I felt my proposal wasn't
good enough. Maybe it wasn't or maybe it was but to my astonishment my mentors
showed confidence in me and selected me. It is going to be a challenging task
for sure. Hoping to have lots of fun and looking forward to learning many new
things this summer.

You can see my proposal [here](https://github.com/patniharshit/patniharshit.github.io/blob/master/patni-harshit.pdf)

More on my journey in open source in next post.
