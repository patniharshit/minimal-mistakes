This week mentor suggested me to go through the existing colormap code in
Matplotlib. New classes for 2D Colormaps will also be developed on similar
lines and in some case will inherit from them.

* Went through cm.py, colors.py. Trying to understand how 1D normalizations
  works, how user data is mapped to a colormap etc
* Halfway through colorbar.py
* Converted `colorbar_only` example in matplotlib gallery into a tutorial
  [#8600](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/8600)
* Fixed an issue by adding test for `_num_to_string` method used in `__call__`
  of `LogFormatter` [#8598](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/8598)
* Removed `resolution` kwarg from `PolarAxes` 
  [#8643](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/8643)
* Debugged failing tests because of segmentation fault in Qt backend
