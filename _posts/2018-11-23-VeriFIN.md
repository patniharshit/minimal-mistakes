## Problem

* Lot of people put false work experience and other information on Linkedin in order to gain attention of the recruiters.
* Given a linkedin profile, determine the evidence of authenticity of information present on the user's linkedin profile from publicly available information about that user on other social networks (for example facebook).

## Data Collection

* Approach:
	* Given a username on linkedin, we scrape the information on the profile (such as work experience, education etc). 
	* From the personal information such as name, age, city etc, we then go to facebook and search for similar profiles.
	* We  try to find the most similar profile from the search result. 
	* We then scrape the timeline of the user and compare that information with the information on linkedin profile.


* Method:
	* Linkedin does not provide any API to get the user profile information. 
	* Wrote a scraper using selenium to scrape the user profile information.
	* We also wrote a script to get all the connections of a user studying at IIIT-H.
	* Facebook also does not provide any API to get posts on user timeline.
	* Wrote scraper to get all timeline posts on a given user.

* Data-processing: 
	* Data cleaning (lower casing and stemming)
	* Retrieving hashtags from posts
	* NER (DBPedia spotlight, spacy NER)
	* Tokenize

* Score Calculation
	* For one job post, we go through all the facebook posts and calculate following similarity scores::
		* Tokenized matching
		* Jaccard Similarity on n gram
		* Cosine similarity
		* Profile match score (matching profile information like name, city, age etc)
	* The score is incremented based on the number of reacts on that fb post. 
	* For cosine similarity we take a thresholding strategy, where we only increment the score when the similarity is above a certain threshold. 
	* We consider 4 different thresholds i.e 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
	* Now, we have 5 different scores for a single linkedin post. To obtain a final score we take a weighted mean. 
	* The final score is calculated by taking the weighted sum of all the similarity scores.

* Analysis

* Challenges faced

	* Coreference resolution of abbreviations. For eg, FB and Facebook are same thing.
	* Tokenized matching doesn’t always work. For eg,
		* Linkedin post: “Intern at Google”
		* Facebook post: “I would love to work at Google” 
	* Need to figure out if we can find out when two people became friends on facebook.
