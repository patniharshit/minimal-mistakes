Continuing from the previous weeks I kept on working on getting a good
visualization of some structured data with bivariate maps. Although it a lot
took more time then it should have but finally I was able to plot air
temperature with surface pressure. Although 2D colorbar nowhere near perfect but
I will try to come back to 2D colorbar later in the project once I have some
basic functionality ready with matplotlib.

After this rest of the time I started working for integrating bivariate
mapping with `imshow` function as a first pass and proof of concept. I have
read the code realted to `imshow`, `ScalarMappable` and `_ImageBase` classes
and have got fair amount of idea of how it works. Now the target for next
week will be to write the code to get this done.

So first month flies by and project has merely started. A lot of work is
needed to be done. I will try to get as much as I can during the month of July
which is the last month of vacations.
